Discount Calculator for POS

Introduction

During my Bachelor's in 2022, when I began learning web development, I created this simple discount calculator for a Point of Sale (POS) system. This was the first project where I dove into JavaScript, and it played a crucial role in helping me build logic and understand the basics of programming.

Project Details

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Features:

Calculates discounts based on the total amount:
10% discount for amounts greater than 5000
5% discount for amounts less than 5000
Displays the original price, discount applied, and the net amount to pay

Significance

This project is straightforward, but it was a significant milestone in my learning journey. By working on this calculator, I gained practical experience in applying conditional logic with JavaScript, which laid the foundation for more complex projects.

How to Use

Enter the total amount.
The calculator will automatically determine the discount percentage and display the net amount to pay.
